# RA8875_3.X_Terminal
This is a Fork of Sumotoy's RA8875 driver with minimal terminal functions added. (Tested only on T3.X) This version does have typical line scrolling. It was used with the T3.2 and T3.6 on an Adafruit RA8875 adapter board which has since almost died. I think it is the TFT. Not testest with the new T4. No examples included. For reference only:)
